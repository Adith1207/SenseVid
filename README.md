# üé• SenseVid (Updated for OpenCV 4.x)

An updated version of the [SenseVid](http://w3.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/perso/moufida.maimour/SenseVid/sensevid.html) tool, modernized to work with **OpenCV 4.x** and current Linux environments. SenseVid is a video transmission and evaluation tool for **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)**, offering functionality similar to **EvalVid**, but tailored specifically for video-based WSN protocol assessment.

---

## üìå Why This Repo?

The original SenseVid codebase was designed for **OpenCV 2.x**, which is now obsolete. This repository:

- Updates all legacy OpenCV references to be compatible with **OpenCV 4.x**
- Enables modern compilation using **CMake 3.x** and **GCC 13+**
- Ensures smooth operation on up-to-date Linux distributions

---

## ‚úÖ What's Changed

- Replaced old OpenCV headers with current ones.
- Replaced deprecated constants with modern equivalents (`cv::CAP_*`, etc.).
- Added missing includes like `<iostream>` and applied `using namespace std;` where appropriate.
- Minor code cleanups for compiler compatibility with g++ / cmake 3.x and OpenCV 4.x.

## üß™ Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Tested with OpenCV 4.12
- ‚úÖ Compiles with GCC 13.3, CMake 3.30
- ‚úÖ Works with Cooja integration for vision-based simulation in academic setups
