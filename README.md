# 🎥 SenseVid (Updated for OpenCV 4.x)

An updated version of the [SenseVid](http://w3.cran.univ-lorraine.fr/perso/moufida.maimour/SenseVid/sensevid.html) tool, modernized to work with **OpenCV 4.x** and current Linux environments. SenseVid is a video transmission and evaluation tool for **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)**, offering functionality similar to **EvalVid**, but tailored specifically for video-based WSN protocol assessment.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

The original SenseVid source was last updated for OpenCV 2.x and uses outdated headers and constants. This version fixes those issues and ensures compatibility with OpenCV 4.x and modern Linux distributions.

## ✅ What's Changed

- Replaced old OpenCV headers with current ones.
- Replaced deprecated constants with modern equivalents (`cv::CAP_*`, etc.).
- Added missing includes like `<iostream>` and applied `using namespace std;` where appropriate.
- Minor code cleanups for compiler compatibility with g++ / cmake 3.x and OpenCV 4.x.

## 🧪 Compatibility

- ✅ Tested with OpenCV 4.12
- ✅ Compiles with GCC 13.3, CMake 3.30
- ✅ Works with Cooja integration for vision-based simulation in academic setups
